## Phase 1 (Ideation and BrainStorming)
I am a cat person.So my game is definitely going to be about CATS.While growing up , I was obsessed with endless runner game and my goal was to reach the end of the level which was physically impossible.I was a huge fan of doodle jump so I thought of incorparating doodle jumps with cat because cat are a great jumper.Cats also dont like humans so they jump avoiding humans.So , I present you , roll the drums , draw the curtains....pauses for 5 seconds ...tada Campus Cat Jump.You,ll never play another game again after playing this


## Phase 2 (Game and Level Design)
I did not want to a make a clone of doodle jump so i added new features like using keyboard to move left and right than using a accleratometer.The platform placement was also very different from doodle jump as the platorm are placed randomly yet in some pattern that maintain the difficulty of the gameplay and makes it fun.

Intial Sketches are show below
