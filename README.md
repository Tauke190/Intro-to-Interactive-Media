# Generative Art and Data Visualization 

## Generative Art 
I played with the vertex of the text and created a aesthetic looking effect by drawing a line from the points of the text outline and transforming it

## Data Visualization 
I imported data from the CSV file and visualized it in the bar graph 



### Things that I learned 
1. I learned how to get the points from the text using ````textToFont()```` function and learned to resample the points according to my need 
2. I discovered that when i want to draw the height of the rectangle in the opposition direction , I can simply put a negative sign in the height function 
3. I learned how to use ````loadtoTable()```` function which automatically converts the csv file into a 2D array like data type 
4. I learned to use````resetMatrix()```` function
